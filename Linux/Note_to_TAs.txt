Hi,
I seem to have lost all my bash scripts that we worked on during the Linux Weeks due to updating the Vagrant Linux VM at the end every week (this was suggested by Andre).
However, I have uploaded some of my homework assignments for those weeks to demonstrate my knowledge.
If activity files are required, I would be happy to complete them again and push them to github. 

Please let know.

Thanks,
Phillip Luckiewicz
